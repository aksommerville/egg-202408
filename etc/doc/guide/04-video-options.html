<p>
There's three basic ways to do video in Egg:
<ul>
  <li>Egg Video API</li>
  <li>Software framebuffer</li>
  <li>OpenGL ES 2</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Egg Video API</h2>

<p>
I recommend this approach. It provides simple primitives, blit operations, and very convenient to load images from resources.
</p>

<p>
Declare the framebuffer size in your metadata file, eg: <tt>framebuffer=640x360</tt><br/>
Whatever size you ask for, you will get exactly.
</p>

<p>
There's always a texture ID 1, which is a proxy for the main output.
Each draw operation takes a destination texture ID. This will usually be 1.
If you need to dynamically read the framebuffer size: <tt>egg_texture_get_header(&w,&h,0,1);</tt><br/>
But bear in mind that it's constant and you declared it in metadata, you probably don't need to ask.
</p>

<p>
To draw an image resource, or portion of it, you must first load it into a texture slot.
<pre>
int my_tex_id = egg_texture_new();
if (egg_texture_load_image(my_tex_id, 0, image_res_id) < 0) ...handle error...
egg_draw_decal(
  1, my_tex_id, /* to texid, from texid */
  10, 10,       /* output position */
  0, 0,         /* input position */
  128, 128,     /* size */
  0             /* transform */
);
</pre>
</p>

<p>
If you have less than a dozen or so images, it makes sense to load them all into textures during init.
</p>

<p>
Copying images takes an argument <tt>xform</tt> which is a bitwise OR of <tt>EGG_XFORM_XREV</tt>, <tt>EGG_XFORM_YREV</tt>, and <tt>EGG_XFORM_SWAP</tt>.
With those three things, you can draw every possible axis-aligned transform.
For decals, the output position you state is always the top-left corner of output, and the size is always exactly so in the source image.
For tiles, output is always centered on the position you state.
</p>

<p>
See <tt>egg/egg_video.h</tt> for details about all of the render options.
</p>

<h2>Software Framebuffer</h2>

<p>
As an edge case of the Egg Video API, you can call <tt>egg_texture_upload()</tt> on texture 1, and provide a complete output image.
</p>

<p>
This might be useful if you're implementing something crazy like a 90s-era 3D engine?
I do intend to port Doom to Egg, and will most likely use this approach. TODO.
</p>

<h2>OpenGL ES 2</h2>

<p>
To enable direct OpenGL access, you must declare it in metadata: <tt>framebuffer=640x360 gl</tt>
</p>

<p>
The framebuffer size you declare is only a hint; it guides the window's initial aspect ratio.
</p>

<p>
Include OpenGL headers (there's a set in the egg repo).
</p>

<p>
You must provide storage for strings, if you're going to call <tt>glGetString()</tt>.
Call <tt>egg_video_set_string_buffer()</tt> with some static storage during init.
</p>

<p>
Get the main output's size at the start of each render with <tt>egg_video_get_size(&w, &h);</tt>
It can change any time between frames.
</p>

<p>
You must use VBOs! Do not call <tt>glVertexAttribPointer()</tt> with a pointer to client memory.
That would work for native hosts, but it can't work in web browsers.
Aside from that, I believe everything works consistently desktop vs web.
</p>

<p>
...but I really haven't tested much
