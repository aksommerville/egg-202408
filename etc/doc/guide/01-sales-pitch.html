</ul>

<h2>What is Egg good at?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Retro style sprite based games.</li>
  <li>Point-and-click visual novels.</li>
  <li>Very small deliverable size, and simple packaging.</li>
  <li>Good performance on low-spec hardware.</li>
  <li>Very portable.</li>
  <li>Multiple languages, as long as they read left-to-right and don't require combining glyphs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unsupported features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Networking.</li>
  <li>Recorded audio. You get synth only.</li>
  <li>Filesystem access. You get a simple key/value store only, and the user can disable that too.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Questionable</h2>

<ul>
  <li>3D graphics. We do provide direct OpenGL ES access, but you have to work from scratch there.</li>
  <li>Very large games. The entire ROM gets loaded at startup. Fine in normal cases, but if you really push it there could be performance issues.</li>
  <li>High-level virtual languages (Python, Ruby, Javascript, ...). In theory, you could bring your own interpretter. But by that point, you're probably better off with a different platform.</li>
</ul>
