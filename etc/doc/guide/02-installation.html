</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
Clone wasm-micro-runtime: <tt>https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime</tt> , and build with cmake.
</p>

<p>
You'll need a WebAssembly compiler. I recommend clang.
</p>

<p>
Strongly recommend the WebAssembly Binary Tools. Clone from <tt>https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt</tt> or check your package manager.
</p>

<h2>First Build</h2>

<p>
Clone Egg: <tt>https://github.com/aksommerville/egg</tt>
</p>

<p>
<tt>make</tt>, and it will generate a config file and abort. That happens only the very first time.
</p>

<p>
Edit <tt>etc/config.mk</tt> with paths to your wamr and wabt installations, and the targets you want to build for.
</p>

<p>
<tt>make</tt> again, and it should build the whole project.
A full build from scratch takes about 8 seconds on my 2021 PC running Linux.
</p>

<p>
Anything fails during <tt>make</tt>, check your settings in config.mk, maybe you can fix it.
Anything you can't fix, please open an issue in Egg's Github repo.
</p>

<p>
Now that it's built, try running the included example ROM: `make run`
</p>

<h2>Build the Eggsamples</h2>

<p>
I provide a set of example games, many with extensive client-side utilities that you'll probably find helpful.
You can use these as starting points for your game, or cannibalize them bit-by-bit, or just read as a reference, whatever suits you.
</p>

<p>
Clone: <tt>https://github.com/aksommerville/eggsamples</tt><br/>
Best to clone it right next to egg, it will look there by default.
</p>

<p>
`make` from the root of that repo will build all the games.
</p>

<p>
Then you can `make run-NAME` to try them.
The current list:
<ul>
  <li>lightson: Tests platform features.</li>
  <li>shmup: Tiny space shooter.</li>
  <li>hardboiled: Point-and-click detective story.</li>
  <li>leggend: Zelda style adventure.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Each Eggsample project has pretty much the same Makefile, and you'd be wise to copy it verbatim for new projects.
